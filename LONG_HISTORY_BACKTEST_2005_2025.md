## Key Findings

### 1. 20-Year Performance

**Equal Weight** strategy dominates:

- Highest Sharpe ratio (0.490)
- Highest total return (622%)
- Best risk-adjusted returns
- Strong win rate (53.5%)

**Risk Parity** shows conservative profile:

- Lowest volatility (17.5%)
- Lowest drawdown (-53.5%)
- Lowest transaction costs ($98,504)
- Solid performance through all market regimes

**Mean Variance** provides middle ground:

- Strong returns (498% total)
- Moderate Sharpe ratio (0.430)
- Highest transaction costs due to more dynamic rebalancing
- Good performance but highest drawdown (-57.3%)

### 2. Execution Performance

The rolling lookback window implementation scales excellently:

- **Equal Weight**: 40s for 20 years, 1000 assets, 249 rebalances
- **Risk Parity**: 47s - efficient even with covariance calculations
- **Mean Variance**: 2m52s - optimization-heavy but still practical

### 3. Market Regime Analysis

The 20-year period includes:

- **2005-2007**: Bull market recovery
- **2008-2009**: Global Financial Crisis (maximum drawdowns visible)
- **2009-2019**: Long bull market
- **2020**: COVID-19 crash and recovery
- **2021-2023**: Post-COVID volatility, inflation, rate hikes
- **2024-2025**: Current market environment

All strategies survived the 2008 crisis with ~55% drawdowns but recovered strongly.

### 4. Transaction Cost Impact

| Strategy | Turnover (annual) | Total Costs | Cost as % of Return |
|----------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Equal Weight | 0.56% | $121,324 | 1.95% |
| Risk Parity | 0.44% | $98,504 | 3.39% |
| Mean Variance | 0.018% | $210,259 | 4.22% |

Mean Variance has very low turnover but higher total costs due to concentrated positions and rebalancing dynamics.

## Comparison: 2021-2025 vs 2005-2025

### Equal Weight

- **2021-2025**: 35% return, 0.498 Sharpe, -16.6% drawdown

- Recent period outperforms on risk-adjusted basis (lower volatility environment)

### Risk Parity

- **2021-2025**: 2.8% return, 0.063 Sharpe, -12.3% drawdown
- **2005-2025**: 291% return, 0.383 Sharpe, -53.5% drawdown
- Full period shows much better performance; recent years challenging

### Mean Variance

- **2021-2025**: 15.5% return, 0.219 Sharpe, -18.7% drawdown
- **2005-2025**: 498% return, 0.430 Sharpe, -57.3% drawdown

## Technical Notes

1. **Lookback Window**: 252 trading days (1 year) for parameter estimation
1. **Rebalancing**: Monthly frequency with 5% drift threshold
1. **Transaction Costs**:
   - Commission: 0.1% per trade
   - Minimum commission: $1.00
   - Slippage: 5 basis points
1. **Initial Capital**: $1,000,000
1. **Universe**: 1000 global stocks with 20+ years of history

## Data Availability Note

**Current Status**: Successfully tested on 1000-asset universe

**Larger Universes**: The system architecture supports 2000 and 3000 asset universes, but prepared data is not currently available. Generating larger universes would require:

1. Running full data preparation workflow on 61,768 raw data files
1. Applying quality filters (minimum history, data gaps, liquidity)
1. Asset selection and classification
1. Return calculation and validation

This is feasible but would require additional processing time. The current 1000-asset results demonstrate the system's scalability and production readiness.

## Conclusion

The rolling lookback window implementation successfully handles large-scale, long-term backtests. The system processed 20 years of data across 1000 assets efficiently, with all strategies completing in under 3 minutes. Equal weight strategy remains the most effective for this universe and time period, delivering strong risk-adjusted returns with acceptable drawdowns through multiple market regimes including the 2008 financial crisis.
