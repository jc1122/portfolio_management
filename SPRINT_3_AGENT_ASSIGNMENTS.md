# Sprint 3 Agent Assignments & Parallelization Plan

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Epic:** Issue #68 - Sprint 3: Testing & Refactoring (Production Readiness)
**Total Issues:** 13 issues (#69-#81)
**Parallelization Strategy:** 5 waves for maximum efficiency

______________________________________________________________________

## Executive Summary

Sprint 3 has been organized into **5 waves** of parallel execution to maximize development velocity. Dependencies have been carefully analyzed to ensure:

- Maximum parallelization where possible
- Sequential execution only where dependencies require it
- 2-3x acceleration vs. sequential approach

**Current Status:** ✅ Wave 1 agents assigned and working

______________________________________________________________________

## Dependency Analysis

### Independent Work (Can Parallelize)

- **Phase 1 testing issues** (#69-73): Test different features independently
- **Phase 2 performance issues** (#74-76): Benchmark different components independently
- **Phase 4 documentation** (#80-81): Document different aspects independently

### Sequential Dependencies

- **Phase 3 refactoring**: Issue #77 must complete before #78 and #79
  - Reason: #77 creates shared utilities that #78 and #79 depend on

### Phase Dependencies

- Phase 2 should wait for Phase 1 (validate correctness before benchmarking)
- Phase 3 should wait for Phase 2 (benchmark before optimizing)
- Phase 4 should wait for Phase 3 (document stable code)

## Risk Management

### Potential Bottlenecks

**Wave 1 (Testing):**

- Risk: Long-running tests may take longer than estimated
- Mitigation: Tests can run in parallel, allow up to 2 weeks if needed
- Impact: Low - doesn't block other waves critically

**Wave 3 (Refactoring):**

- Risk: Refactoring may introduce regressions
- Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite must pass, small incremental changes
- Impact: Medium - blocks Wave 4, but single agent minimizes coordination issues

**Wave 5 (Documentation):**

- Risk: Documentation may need updates if code changes during Wave 3-4
- Mitigation: Review code state at Wave 5 start, update as needed
- Impact: Low - documentation is final phase

### Coordination Points

1. **Wave transitions:** Ensure all PRs from previous wave merged before starting next
1. **Test suite:** Must remain green throughout all waves (no breaking changes)
1. **Code review:** Each PR reviewed before merge to maintain quality
1. **Communication:** Update Epic #68 with progress comments

## Monitoring & Progress Tracking

### Daily Check-ins

- Monitor individual issue progress (comments, commits, PRs)
- Check for blockers or questions from agents
- Update Epic #68 with status

### Weekly Milestones

- Week 1 End: Wave 1 complete
- Week 2 End: Wave 2 complete
- Week 3 End: Waves 3-4 complete
- Week 4 End: Wave 5 complete, Sprint 3 done

______________________________________________________________________

## Notes

- All work branches from `main` (commit 4b49785 or later)
- Backward compatibility must be maintained throughout
- Each wave must have all tests passing before moving to next wave
- GitHub Copilot agents work autonomously on assigned issues
- Human review required before merging PRs
- Focus: Quality and reliability over speed
