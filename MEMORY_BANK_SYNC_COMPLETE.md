## Next Recommended Actions

### Before Merging to Main (Optional)

- \[ \] Run full test suite to verify all metrics remain accurate
- \[ \] Create release notes documenting performance improvements
- \[ \] Tag release with optimization improvements

### After Merge to Main

- \[ \] Validate performance improvements at production scale
- \[ \] Deploy optimized system to production workflows
- \[ \] Communicate improvements to stakeholders

### Future Development (Optional â€“ Nice-to-Have)

- \[ \] Consolidate archive redundancies (50 files â†’ ~25)
- \[ \] Organize root directory loose files
- \[ \] Create comprehensive documentation index
- \[ \] Phase 11: Advanced overlays (sentiment, regime-aware)
