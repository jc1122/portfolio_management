# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Action:** Consolidated and cleaned up project documentation

## What Was Done

### 1. Consolidated Refactoring Logs

- **Created:** `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - Single comprehensive document covering all refactoring work
- **Archived:** Moved `REFACTORING_SESSION_1.md`, `REFACTORING_SESSION_2.md`, `REFACTORING_SESSION_3.md` to `archive/` folder
- **Rationale:** Three separate session logs contained overlapping information. Consolidated into one source of truth.

### 2. Updated CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md

- Expanded from single pre-commit fix note to comprehensive cleanup document
- Added refactoring overview section
- Cross-referenced `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` for details

### 3. Refreshed README.md

- Updated repository structure diagram to show new modular architecture
- Replaced status section with clear phase-based progress tracker
- Added references to `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` and Memory Bank
- Cleaned up outdated implementation details

### 4. Updated Memory Bank

**progress.md:**

- Restructured as clear milestone tracker with completion checkboxes
- Added priority-ordered technical debt section
- Created risk/mitigation table
- Organized future work into distinct phases

**activeContext.md:**

- Focused on immediate next steps (technical debt, data curation, design)
- Updated architecture diagram
- Consolidated key decisions and constraints
- Added development principles section

## New Documentation Structure

```
Root Level:
  AGENTS.md                 # Session boot instructions
  README.md                 # Project overview (updated)
  CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md        # Performance & refactoring overview (updated)
  REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md    # Detailed refactoring history (new)

Memory Bank:
  projectbrief.md           # Original scope and goals
  productContext.md         # Product requirements
  systemPatterns.md         # Architectural patterns
  techContext.md            # Technical constraints
  activeContext.md          # Current focus (updated)
  progress.md               # Milestone tracker (updated)

Archive:
  REFACTORING_SESSION_1.md  # Archived
  REFACTORING_SESSION_2.md  # Archived
  REFACTORING_SESSION_3.md  # Archived
```

## Key Improvements

### Clarity

- Single source of truth for refactoring history
- Clear separation between completed work and future plans
- Phase-based organization makes progress visible

### Maintainability

- Less duplication across documents
- Easier to update (one refactoring doc vs. three session logs)
- Clear cross-references between documents

### Actionability

- Technical debt items prioritized
- Next steps clearly defined with time estimates
- Risk/mitigation table highlights key concerns

## Next Session Checklist

When starting new work:

1. ✅ Read `AGENTS.md`
1. ✅ Review all Memory Bank files
1. ✅ Check `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` for context
1. ✅ Review `activeContext.md` for immediate priorities
1. ✅ Update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` after completing work
1. ✅ Keep `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` current if making architectural changes

## Notes

- Old session logs preserved in `archive/` for reference
- All changes tracked in git (not yet committed)
- Memory Bank now reflects clean post-refactor state
- Ready to begin Phase 2 work (technical debt resolution → portfolio construction)
