# Refactoring Summary

**Period:** October 14-15, 2025
**Branch:** `scripts/prepare_tradeable_data.py-refactor`
**Test Status:** 17 tests passing, 75% coverage

## What Was Done

### Session 1: Code Quality Foundations

- Added comprehensive docstrings to CLI script and dataclasses
- Replaced legacy `typing` aliases with modern built-in annotations
- Extracted magic numbers into named constants (ZERO_VOLUME_THRESHOLD, etc.)
- Cleaned up unused imports and dead code
- Added targeted ruff/mypy suppressions for known complexity

### Session 2: Function Decomposition

- Split `summarize_price_file` into focused helpers (read, validate, calculate, flag)
- Refactored `candidate_tickers` into `_get_desired_extensions` + `_generate_initial_candidates`
- Introduced `ExportConfig` dataclass to reduce parameter passing in `export_tradeable_prices`

### Session 3: Module Extraction

- Created `models.py` for shared dataclasses
- Created `utils.py` for general utilities
- Created `io.py` for all I/O operations
- Created `analysis.py` for validation/diagnostic logic
- Created `matching.py` for ticker matching heuristics
- Created `stooq.py` for index building
- Reduced `prepare_tradeable_data.py` to thin CLI orchestrator

### Infrastructure Improvements

- Fixed pytest pre-commit hook stalling (scoped to `tests/` only)
- Configured all tooling to exclude 70K-file `data/` tree
- Set up GitHub Actions CI with full test suite
- Established Memory Bank for persistent context

## Current Architecture

```
scripts/prepare_tradeable_data.py    # CLI orchestrator
└── src/portfolio_management/
    ├── models.py      # Dataclasses
    ├── io.py          # File I/O
    ├── analysis.py    # Validation & metrics
    ├── matching.py    # Ticker matching
    ├── stooq.py       # Index building
    └── utils.py       # Shared utilities
```

## Outstanding Technical Debt

### High Priority

1. **Matching complexity:** `_match_instrument` has complex branching that needs simplification
1. **Stooq concurrency:** `_collect_relative_paths` thread implementation needs review and tests
1. **Analysis helpers:** Tighten boundaries in `summarize_price_file` pipeline

### Medium Priority

4. **Parallel runner:** Review `_run_in_parallel` usage patterns and document expectations
1. **Lint warnings:** Address remaining complexity/performance lints in matching and export

## Next Development Phases

### Phase 1: Complete Data Prep Module (Current)

- \[ \] Address technical debt items above
- \[ \] Finalize tradable universe (broker fees, FX policy, unmatched resolution)
- \[ \] Document empty Stooq histories and remediation plan

### Phase 2: Portfolio Construction Layer

- \[ \] Design strategy adapter interface
- \[ \] Implement core allocation strategies (equal-weight, risk-parity, mean-variance)
- \[ \] Add rebalance logic with monthly/quarterly cadence
- \[ \] Implement portfolio guardrails (max 25% per ETF, min 10% bonds, cap 90% equities)

### Phase 3: Backtesting Framework

- \[ \] Build historical simulation engine
- \[ \] Add transaction cost modeling (commissions, slippage)
- \[ \] Implement performance analytics (Sharpe, drawdown, turnover)
- \[ \] Create reporting outputs

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- \[ \] Integrate sentiment/news overlays as satellite tilts
- \[ \] Add Black-Litterman view blending
- \[ \] Implement regime-aware controls
- \[ \] Add automated Stooq refresh (when online access approved)

## Key Constraints

- **Offline operation:** No automated downloads until user approval
- **Data quality:** Zero-volume warnings only; manual remediation pending
- **Testing:** Maintain 17+ passing tests, target 80%+ coverage for new code
- **Performance:** All tooling must exclude `data/` tree to avoid scans
