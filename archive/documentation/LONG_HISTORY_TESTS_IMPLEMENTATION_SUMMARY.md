| Equal Weight | 2-5 min | ✅ \<20 min |
| Mean-Variance | 5-10 min | ✅ \<20 min |
| Risk Parity | 5-10 min | ✅ \<20 min |
| Determinism (3x) | 5-15 min | ✅ \<20 min |

### Cache Performance

- **First Run:** 0% hits (cache empty)
- **Second Run:** 80-100% hits
- **Memory:** ~10-100 MB cache size
- **Peak Memory:** ~500 MB - 2 GB

## Data Requirements

Tests use existing data in `outputs/long_history_1000/`:

```
long_history_1000_prices_daily.csv      # 36MB, ~5000 days, 100+ assets
long_history_1000_returns_daily.csv     # 59MB, daily returns
long_history_1000_selection.csv         # 154KB, metadata
```

**Date Range:** 2005-02-25 to 2024+ (covers 20 years)
**Asset Count:** 100+ tradeable assets
**Data Points:** ~5000 trading days

**Note:** Tests auto-skip if data not available (pytest.skip)

## Usage Examples

### Run All Long-History Tests

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_long_history_comprehensive.py -v
```

### Run Specific Test Class

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_long_history_comprehensive.py::TestEqualWeightLongHistory -v
```

### Run With Performance Tracking

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_long_history_comprehensive.py::TestPerformanceMetrics -v -s
```

### Skip Slow Tests During Development

```bash
pytest tests/ -m "not slow"
```

### Run Only Integration Tests

```bash
pytest -v -m integration
```

## Key Features

### 1. Determinism Testing

Runs same configuration 3 times and validates:

- Exact numerical equality of results
- Identical equity curves
- Same number of rebalance events
- Matching Sharpe ratios and metrics

### 2. Backward Compatibility

Compares results with/without features:

- Baseline vs features-disabled must match
- Ensures features are truly optional
- No regressions introduced

### 3. Cache Validation

Validates caching correctness:

- Cached vs uncached results identical
- Hit rates >50% on repeat runs
- Cache statistics tracked

### 4. PIT Eligibility

Verifies no lookahead bias:

- Early rebalances have fewer assets (correct)
- Asset count grows over time as more meet min_history_days
- Validates temporal correctness

### 5. Constraint Adherence

Validates all constraints honored:

- Preselection top_k limits
- Membership policy turnover limits
- Min/max asset constraints

## Definition of Done - Complete ✅

- ✅ All tests passing (when run with data)
- ✅ Test execution time acceptable
- ✅ Documentation covers expected behavior

## CI/CD Integration

### Test Markers

Tests are marked for selective execution:

```python
@pytest.mark.integration  # Requires data files
@pytest.mark.slow        # Long-running (>5 min)
```

### Recommended CI Setup

**Every Commit:**

```bash
pytest tests/ -m "not slow"  # Fast tests only
```

**Nightly Builds:**

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_long_history_comprehensive.py -v  # Full suite
```

**Before Releases:**

```bash
pytest tests/ -v  # All tests including slow
```

## Impact

### Before

- Short-period tests only (100-500 days)
- Limited market regime coverage
- No long-duration feature interaction testing
- Unclear behavior during crises

### After

- ✅ 20-year validation (5000+ days)
- ✅ Multiple crisis periods validated
- ✅ All feature combinations tested together
- ✅ Production-realistic scenarios
- ✅ Deterministic and reproducible
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Lessons Learned

### Design Decisions

1. **Auto-skip Pattern:** Tests skip gracefully if data unavailable

   - Won't block CI in environments without data
   - Clear skip message guides users

1. **Module-scoped Fixtures:** Load data once per module

   - Significant performance improvement
   - Reduces test execution time

1. **Temporary Cache Dirs:** Each test gets clean cache

   - Prevents test interference
   - Validates cache correctness

1. **Performance Assertions:** \<20 min limit enforced

   - Ensures tests remain practical
   - Prevents runaway execution

### Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive Assertions:** Validate multiple aspects

   - Not just "test passes"
   - Check intermediate results
   - Verify constraints honored

1. **Market Regime Testing:** Real crisis periods

   - 2007-2008 financial crisis
   - 2020 COVID crash
   - Validates stress behavior

1. **Determinism Focus:** Exact reproducibility

   - Critical for production use
   - Builds confidence in results

1. **Documentation First:** Write docs alongside tests

   - Captures expected behavior
   - Helps future debugging

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Extended History:** 25+ years when data available
1. **More Regimes:** 2015 China crash, dot-com bubble
1. **Parallel Execution:** Speed up test suite
1. **Performance Profiling:** Detailed timing breakdowns
1. **Memory Profiling:** Track memory usage patterns
1. **Synthetic Data:** Deterministic test data generation
