# Sprint 3: Testing & Refactoring Plan

**Created:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase
**Focus:** Ensure all Sprint 2 functionality is production-ready through comprehensive testing and targeted refactoring

______________________________________________________________________

## Executive Summary

Sprint 2 delivered significant new features:

- Factor-based preselection (momentum, low-vol, combined)
- Membership policy with turnover controls
- Point-in-time (PIT) eligibility for no-lookahead backtesting
- Factor and PIT eligibility caching
- Optional fast IO (polars/pyarrow)

All features have unit tests and basic integration tests (615 tests total, all passing). However, there are gaps in:

1. **Long-duration testing** - Most tests use short time periods (100-500 days)
1. **Edge case coverage** - Sparse data, delistings, universe changes
1. **Performance characterization** - No benchmarks for production scenarios
1. **Code quality** - Some duplicated logic, inconsistent patterns

**Sprint 3 Goal:** Make Sprint 2 features production-ready through comprehensive testing and quality improvements.

## Sprint 2 Code Review Summary

### ✅ What Works Well

**Testing Coverage:**

- 615 total tests passing (0 failures, 1 xfail expected)
- 43 integration tests including:
  - 6 backtest integration tests (all feature combinations)
  - 14 caching integration tests (factor + PIT)
  - 2 smoke tests with long-history data
  - Multiple performance benchmarks

**Code Quality:**

- Zero ruff errors (clean code style)
- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Good separation of concerns

**Features:**

- All Sprint 2 features functional and documented
- Backward compatible (features opt-in via CLI flags)
- Good API design (clear configuration classes)

### ⚠️ Testing Gaps Identified

1. **Long-History Testing**

   - Most tests use 100-500 days of data
   - Only 2 smoke tests with real 2005-2025 data (marked skipif)
   - Need comprehensive 20-year backtests with all features enabled
   - Missing: market crash scenarios (2008, 2020)

1. **Edge Cases**

   - PIT eligibility: sparse data, gaps, delisting detection not fully tested
   - Membership policy: boundary conditions, all assets dropped scenario
   - Preselection: ties, empty result sets, single-asset edge cases
   - Caching: cache corruption, disk full, concurrent access

1. **Performance Characterization**

   - Cache performance unknown in production (hit rates, memory usage)
   - Fast IO speedup measured but not extensively benchmarked
   - Preselection computation time unknown for large universes (1000+ assets)
   - No memory profiling for long-running backtests

1. **Feature Interactions**

   - Limited testing of all features enabled simultaneously
   - Missing: preselection + membership + PIT + caching together
   - Missing: fast IO with all features enabled
   - Missing: universe changes mid-backtest

### 🔧 Refactoring Opportunities

1. **Code Duplication**

   - Date handling logic repeated across modules
   - Configuration validation patterns duplicated
   - Test fixture setup duplicated

1. **Error Handling**

   - Some functions lack input validation
   - Error messages could be more actionable
   - Missing edge case handling in some paths

1. **Documentation Gaps**

   - Good individual feature docs exist
   - Missing: comprehensive workflow examples
   - Missing: troubleshooting guide
   - Missing: performance tuning guide

1. **Type Safety**

   - Some `Any` types could be more specific
   - Missing protocol definitions for interfaces

## Timeline Estimate

**Total Duration:** 3-4 weeks

- **Week 1:** Phase 1 - Extended Testing (Issues #68-72)
- **Week 2:** Phase 2 - Performance & Profiling (Issues #73-75)
- **Week 3:** Phase 3 - Code Quality (Issues #76-78)
- **Week 4:** Phase 4 - Documentation (Issues #79-80)

**Note:** Issues can be parallelized where dependencies allow. P0 issues should be completed before P1 issues.

______________________________________________________________________

## Dependencies

- **None** - All work builds on completed Sprint 2
- All work branches from `main` (commit 4b49785 or later)
- No external dependencies required

______________________________________________________________________

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk

- Testing improvements (can't break existing functionality)
- Documentation additions (pure additions)
- Performance benchmarking (read-only)

### Medium Risk

- Refactoring (could introduce regressions)
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite runs after each change
  - Mitigation: Small, incremental changes with reviews

### High Risk

- None identified

______________________________________________________________________

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **NOT** in Sprint 3 scope:

1. **New Features** - Focus is on hardening existing features
1. **Advanced Cardinality** - Issue #41 stubs are complete; implementation deferred
1. **Clustering/Diversification** - Issue #32 deferred from Sprint 2
1. **Technical Indicators** - Issue #33 deferred from Sprint 2
1. **Macro Regime Hooks** - Issue #34 deferred from Sprint 2

These may be addressed in Sprint 4 or later.

______________________________________________________________________

## Next Steps

1. **Create Sprint 3 Epic Issue** (#68+) - Define high-level scope
1. **Create detailed sub-issues** (#69-80) - Break down work
1. **Assign priorities** - P0, P1, P2 labels
1. **Begin Phase 1** - Start with long-history integration tests
1. **Update memory bank** - Document Sprint 3 objectives

______________________________________________________________________

## Notes

- All issues should be created as sub-issues of the Sprint 3 epic
- Each issue should have clear acceptance criteria
- Testing issues should include expected failure scenarios
- Performance issues should include baseline measurements
- Documentation issues should include examples
- All work must maintain backward compatibility
