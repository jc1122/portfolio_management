# Refactoring Session 2: Medium-Sized Cleanups

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Test status:** 17 tests passing (coverage up to 75%).

**Highlights**
- Broke `summarize_price_file` into focused helpers for reading, validation, metric calculation, and flag generation, trimming the original cyclomatic complexity.
- Streamlined `candidate_tickers` via `_get_desired_extensions` and `_generate_initial_candidates`, making the matching heuristics easier to reason about.
- Wrapped exporter parameters inside an `ExportConfig` dataclass to cut the long argument list for `export_tradeable_prices`.

Outstanding refactor tasks are tracked centrally in `memory-bank/progress.md`.
