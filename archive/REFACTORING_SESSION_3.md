# Refactoring Session 3: Modularization

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Test status:** 17 tests passing (coverage steady at 75%).

**Highlights**
- Moved shared dataclasses into `src/portfolio_management/models.py` and general utilities into `utils.py`.
- Split I/O concerns into `io.py`, analytical/validation logic into `analysis.py`, and matching heuristics into `matching.py`; added `stooq.py` for indexing helpers.
- Left `scripts/prepare_tradeable_data.py` as a thin orchestrator that wires the modules together while preserving the CLI contract.

**Outcome**
- The data-prep workflow now has clear module boundaries, making future extensions (CLI/backtesting layers, sentiment overlays) easier to integrate.

Outstanding refinements for this area are listed in `memory-bank/progress.md`.
