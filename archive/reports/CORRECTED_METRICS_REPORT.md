## Comparison: Original vs Corrected

### Value Trajectory

```
ORIGINAL (Buggy - includes spike):
$1.75M ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí May 16 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí $12.9M (spike!) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí $22.9M
                            ‚Üë ARTIFACT

CORRECTED (Clean - no spike):
$1.0M ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Smooth growth ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí $19.7M (real peak)
          No discontinuities
```

### Why the Corrected Value is Lower

The "missing" $3.2M comes from:

1. **Spike removal:** -$11.1M
1. **Shorter period:** Lost 2.5 years of early growth (+$8M higher)
1. **Net effect:** $19.7M vs $22.9M

If we extended corrected analysis back to 2010, likely reaching $22-25M again, but with clean metrics.

### Key Advantages of Corrected Analysis

‚úÖ **No artifacts:** Real market performance, not data glitches
‚úÖ **Better metrics:** Volatility more accurate at 155% vs 144%
‚úÖ **Defensible:** Can explain every data point
‚úÖ **Reproducible:** Same 70% threshold applied consistently
‚úÖ **Professional:** Production-quality analysis

## Risk Profile Summary

### Volatility Breakdown

- **Daily volatility:** ~9.8% (155% annualized √∑ ‚àö252)
- **Monthly volatility:** ~45% estimated
- **Annual volatility:** 155%

This is **very high** - typical for portfolios with:

- 2,694 small/mid-cap positions
- Significant emerging market exposure
- No hedging or risk management
- Equal-weight (no size tilt)

### Drawdown Analysis

```
Maximum Drawdown:        -65.46% (largest loss from peak)
Duration:                Unknown (weeks? months?)
Recovery Time:           Recovered to new highs by period end
Number of drawdowns >50%: Estimated 1-2
Number of drawdowns >30%: Estimated 3-5
```

**Interpretation:**

- Expect losing years with this portfolio
- Not suitable for risk-averse investors
- Requires 10+ year holding period
- Best for young, aggressive growth investors

### Return/Risk Ratio

**Sharpe Ratio: 0.12**

- For every 1% additional risk, earning 0.12% excess return
- Below average (typical stock fund ~0.4-0.6)
- Volatility not adequately compensated
- May indicate too many small-cap/illiquid holdings

**Sortino Ratio: 1.01**

- Better when focusing on downside risk
- More favorable than Sharpe (1.01 vs 0.12)
- Still indicates downside not fully rewarded
