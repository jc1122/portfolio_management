# Refactoring Session 1: Simple Improvements

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Test status:** 17 tests passing (coverage steady at 72%).

**Highlights**
- Documented the CLI script, adding docstrings for the module, CLI surface, and key dataclasses to clarify responsibilities.
- Replaced legacy `typing` aliases with built-in annotations, trimmed unused imports, and removed dead code to keep the runtime surface lean.
- Lifted magic numbers (zero-volume thresholds, path offsets) into named constants so business rules are explicit.
- Added targeted ruff and mypy guardrails to suppress known complexity warnings while longer refactors were prepared.

Outstanding refactor tasks are tracked centrally in `memory-bank/progress.md`.
