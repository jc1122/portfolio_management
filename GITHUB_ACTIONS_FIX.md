# GitHub Actions Dependency Fix Summary

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem

The GitHub Actions test workflow was failing with the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File ".../riskparityportfolio/__init__.py", line 7, in <module>
    from .rpp import *
  File ".../riskparityportfolio/rpp.py", line 4, in <module>
    from .riskfunctions import (
  File ".../riskparityportfolio/riskfunctions.py", line 1, in <module>
    import jax.numpy as np
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jax'
```

Additionally, there was a warning about missing `quadprog`:

```
UserWarning: not able to import quadprog. the successive convex optimizer wont work.
```

## Root Cause

The `riskparityportfolio` package depends on:

1. **jax** - JAX library for numerical computations
1. **jaxlib** - JAX's native library backend
1. **quadprog** - Quadratic programming solver

These dependencies were not explicitly listed in our requirements files, causing import failures in CI environments where dependencies are installed from scratch.

## Solution

Updated both dependency files to include the missing packages:

### 1. `requirements.txt`

Added:

```
# Dependencies for riskparityportfolio
jax>=0.3.0
jaxlib>=0.3.0
quadprog>=0.1.11
```

### 2. `pyproject.toml`

Added to the `dependencies` list:

```toml
"jax>=0.3.0",
"jaxlib>=0.3.0",
"quadprog>=0.1.11",
```

## Version Constraints

- **jax/jaxlib**: Set to `>=0.3.0` for compatibility with Python 3.9+
  - Note: jax 0.4.30+ requires Python 3.10+ due to usage of `match` statements
  - The `>=0.3.0` constraint ensures compatibility with both local dev (Python 3.9) and CI (Python 3.12)
- **quadprog**: Set to `>=0.1.11` for latest stable version

## Verification

Created `test_dependencies.py` to verify all dependencies:

```python
✓ Core dependencies OK
✓ empyrical-reloaded OK
✓ PyPortfolioOpt OK
✓ riskparityportfolio OK (includes jax, jaxlib, quadprog)
```

Tested in:

1. ✅ Local development environment (Python 3.9)
1. ✅ Fresh virtual environment (Python 3.9)
1. ✅ GitHub Actions simulation

## Files Modified

1. `/workspaces/portfolio_management/requirements.txt`

   - Added jax, jaxlib, quadprog

1. `/workspaces/portfolio_management/pyproject.toml`

   - Added jax, jaxlib, quadprog to dependencies list

1. `/workspaces/portfolio_management/test_dependencies.py` (NEW)

   - Created verification script for all dependencies

## GitHub Actions Status

The `.github/workflows/tests.yml` workflow should now pass the "Verify critical dependencies" step without errors:

```yaml
- name: Verify critical dependencies
  run: |
    python -c "import pandas; import numpy; import yaml; import scipy; import cvxpy; print('Core dependencies OK')"
    python -c "import empyrical; print('empyrical-reloaded OK')"
    python -c "import pypfopt; print('PyPortfolioOpt OK')"
    python -c "import riskparityportfolio; print('riskparityportfolio OK')"
    python -c "import portfolio_management; print('portfolio_management package OK')"
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Dependencies are fixed and verified
1. ⏭️ Commit changes to trigger GitHub Actions
1. ⏭️ Verify CI pipeline passes

## Notes

- The dev container runs Python 3.9.2 while CI uses Python 3.12
- JAX version constraint `>=0.3.0` works with both versions
- No changes needed to `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
- All existing functionality remains intact
