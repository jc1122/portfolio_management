# Portfolio Construction Script: `construct_portfolio.py`

## Overview

This script is the fifth step in the portfolio management toolkit's data pipeline. This is where financial theory is applied to the historical returns data to create a portfolio.

Its purpose is to take the matrix of asset returns and, based on a chosen investment strategy and a set of user-defined constraints, calculate the optimal **weight** (or allocation percentage) for each asset.

Like the other scripts, this file acts as a command-line **orchestrator** for the core logic encapsulated in the `PortfolioConstructor` class.

## Inputs (Prerequisites)

This script requires one primary input and one optional input from previous steps:

1. **Returns Matrix CSV (Required)**

   - **Generated by**: `scripts/calculate_returns.py`
   - **Specified via**: `--returns`
   - **Purpose**: This file provides the historical return data for all assets, which is the foundation for all quantitative strategies.

1. **Classifications CSV (Optional)**

   - **Generated by**: `scripts/classify_assets.py`
   - **Specified via**: `--classifications`
   - **Purpose**: This file is only needed if you intend to use constraints based on asset classes, such as `--max-equity` or `--min-bond`.

## Script Products

The script's output depends on its mode of operation:

1. **Portfolio Weights CSV (Primary Product)**

   - **Description**: When running with a single strategy, the script produces a CSV file with two columns: one for the asset tickers and one for their calculated `weight` in the portfolio. This file is the direct input for the `run_backtest.py` script.

1. **Strategy Comparison CSV**

   - **Description**: When running with the `--compare` flag, the script produces a CSV file where the rows are the asset tickers and each column represents a different investment strategy. The values in the table are the weights assigned to each asset by each strategy. This is useful for analysis and comparison.

## Features in Detail

### Portfolio Construction Strategies

The core feature of the script is its ability to build a portfolio using different industry-standard strategies, controlled by the `--strategy` flag.

- `equal_weight`: The simplest baseline. It assigns an equal weight to every asset (1/N).
- `mean_variance_max_sharpe`: A classic Modern Portfolio Theory strategy that finds the portfolio with the mathematically optimal risk-adjusted return (highest Sharpe Ratio).
- `mean_variance_min_volatility`: An MPT strategy that finds the portfolio with the lowest possible risk (volatility), regardless of return.
- `risk_parity`: An advanced strategy that allocates capital so that each asset contributes equally to the overall portfolio risk.

### Portfolio Constraints

Constraints are rules that the final portfolio must obey. They allow you to enforce your own views or risk limits on top of the chosen strategy.

- `--max-weight` / `--min-weight`: Sets the maximum and minimum allowable weight for any single asset.
- `--max-equity`: Sets the maximum total allocation to all assets classified as "equity".
- `--min-bond`: Sets the minimum total allocation to all assets classified as "fixed_income" or "cash".

### Strategy Comparison Mode

Instead of building a single portfolio, you can use the `--compare` flag. This tells the script to run **all** available strategies and generate a single table comparing the weights produced by each, making it easy to see how different theories allocate capital to the same set of assets.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Construct a simple equal-weight portfolio
python scripts/construct_portfolio.py \
  --returns data/processed/returns.csv \
  --strategy equal_weight \
  --output outputs/portfolio_equal_weight.csv
```

```bash
# Construct a Mean-Variance portfolio with exposure constraints
python scripts/construct_portfolio.py \
  --returns data/processed/returns.csv \
  --classifications data/processed/classified_assets.csv \
  --strategy mean_variance_max_sharpe \
  --max-equity 0.80 \
  --min-bond 0.15 \
  --output outputs/portfolio_mv.csv
```

```bash
# Compare all available strategies
python scripts/construct_portfolio.py \
  --returns data/processed/returns.csv \
  --compare \
  --output outputs/portfolio_comparison.csv
```

## Command-Line Arguments

- `--returns`: **(Required)** Path to the CSV file containing asset returns.
- `--output`: **(Required)** Path to write the resulting portfolio weights CSV.
- `--classifications`: Optional path to the classified assets CSV, required for exposure constraints.
- `--strategy`: The name of the strategy to use (e.g., `equal_weight`). Default: `equal_weight`.
- `--compare`: If specified, runs all strategies and compares them.
- `--max-weight`: Maximum weight for any single asset. Default: `0.25`.
- `--min-weight`: Minimum weight for any single asset. Default: `0.0`.
- `--max-equity`: Maximum total exposure to equity. Default: `0.90`.
- `--min-bond`: Minimum total exposure to bonds/cash. Default: `0.10`.
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging output.
