# CI Test Strategy

This document defines the standard test selections and timeouts used by the
continuous integration (CI) pipelines and recommended local workflows.

## Test Bands

| Band | Purpose | Marker Expression | Timeout | Trigger |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Smoke** | Validate critical functionality in seconds | `unit` | 10s per test | Every commit (pre-push) |
| **Core** | Validate primary workflows without long scenarios | `unit or integration` and `not slow` | 60s per test | Pull requests |
| **Full** | Exhaustive verification including slow and data-heavy suites | none (entire `tests/`) | 120s per test | Nightly / scheduled |

All commands inherit the default configuration from `pytest.ini`, including the
60-second global timeout and registered markers.

## Recommended Pipelines

### 1. Local Development Hook (Optional Pre-Commit)

Run the fastest suite while iterating on code:

```bash
pytest -m unit -v --maxfail=1
```

Add `-n auto` to leverage xdist when multiple CPU cores are available.

### 2. Pull Request Validation

Combine fast unit coverage with integration checks while skipping long-running
scenarios:

```bash
pytest -m "unit or integration" -v --timeout=60
```

The `--timeout` flag is optional because the same value is configured globally,
but keeping it explicit in CI scripts makes intent clear.

### 3. Slow & Data-Heavy Scenarios

Nightly or scheduled jobs should cover slow performance and data-dependent
tests to catch regressions that may not appear in fast feedback loops:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --timeout=120
```

If the environment has access to the large Stooq datasets, include
`pytest -m requires_data` as part of the schedule.

## Marker Conventions in CI

- `slow` markers are excluded from the Pull Request band to keep runtime under
  one minute. Use `pytest -m "not slow"` for this filter.
- `performance` benchmarks should run in dedicated jobs where timing stability is
  guaranteed (fixed CPU allocations).
- `requires_data` tests only run when the backing datasets are mounted. CI jobs
  that lack the data should skip these suites using `-m "not requires_data"`.
- `e2e` suites are optional for nightly builds but recommended before releases.

## Adding New Pipelines

When introducing a new CI workflow:

1. Decide which marker expression best fits the jobâ€™s goal.
2. Reference this document in the workflow description.
3. Ensure the command uses the global timeout or overrides it explicitly.
4. Update this table if the pipeline creates a new band (e.g., weekly stress
   tests).

Keeping CI commands centralized avoids drift between developer expectations and
automation, ensuring fast feedback without sacrificing coverage.
