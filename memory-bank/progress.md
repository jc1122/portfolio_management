# Progress Log

## Current Status

**Branch:** `scripts/prepare_tradeable_data.py-refactor`
**Test Status:** 17 tests passing, 75% coverage
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + pre-commit hooks enforcing quality gates

The data preparation pipeline has been successfully modularized into 6 focused modules (`analysis`, `io`, `matching`, `models`, `stooq`, `utils`) with `scripts/prepare_tradeable_data.py` serving as the CLI orchestrator.

## Completed Milestones

### Data Preparation Pipeline (✓ Complete)
- ✅ Modular architecture extracted from monolithic script
- ✅ Pandas-based processing with validation and diagnostics
- ✅ Zero-volume severity tagging and currency reconciliation
- ✅ Broker tradeable ingestion and report generation
- ✅ Match/unmatched reports and curated price exports
- ✅ 17 regression tests with 75% coverage
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline configured
- ✅ Performance optimization (pytest scoped away from 70K-file `data/` tree)
- ✅ Memory Bank established for session persistence

### Documentation & Infrastructure (✓ Complete)
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- ✅ Modern type annotations (no legacy `typing` aliases)
- ✅ Named constants for business rules
- ✅ `pyproject.toml`, `mypy.ini`, `requirements-dev.txt` configured
- ✅ All tooling excludes `data/` directory for performance

## Recent Technical Debt Resolutions (Latest Session - All 4 Tasks Complete)

### Task 1: Type Annotations (✓ Complete)
- ✅ Installed `pandas-stubs` and `types-PyYAML` to requirements-dev.txt
- ✅ Added TypeVar-based generics to `utils._run_in_parallel`
- ✅ Parameterized all `Counter` → `Counter[str]` and `dict` → `dict[str, X]` throughout codebase
- ✅ Fixed return type annotations in `analysis._calculate_data_quality_metrics` and `io._prepare_match_report_data`
- ✅ **Result:** mypy errors reduced from 40+ to 9 (78% reduction)
- ✅ All 17 original tests remain passing with 75% coverage

### Task 2: Concurrency Implementation (✓ Complete)
- ✅ Enhanced `utils._run_in_parallel` with three major improvements:
  * Result ordering via index mapping (new `preserve_order` parameter, default True)
  * Comprehensive error handling with task index context (RuntimeError wrapping)
  * Optional diagnostics logging (new `log_tasks` parameter, default False)
  * Error handling in sequential path matching parallel path
- ✅ Created 18 comprehensive tests in `tests/test_utils.py` covering:
  * Sequential/parallel execution modes
  * Result ordering preservation
  * Error scenarios and edge cases
  * Diagnostics logging
  * Timing variance resilience
- ✅ **Result:** 35 total tests passing (17 original + 18 new), zero regressions

### Task 3: Matching Logic Simplification (✓ Complete)
- ✅ Refactored `matching.py` strategies to reduce cyclomatic complexity by 55%:
  * Extracted `_extension_is_acceptable` helper in TickerMatchingStrategy
  * Applied same pattern to StemMatchingStrategy
  * Broke BaseMarketMatchingStrategy into 3 focused helper methods (_build_desired_extensions, _get_candidate_extension, _find_matching_entry)
- ✅ Extracted `_match_instrument` helpers to module level:
  * `_build_candidate_extensions` - pre-compute extensions once per instrument
  * `_extract_candidate_extension` - consolidate extraction logic
  * `_build_desired_extensions_for_candidate` - per-candidate extension computation
- ✅ Reduced total matching strategy lines: 157 → 131 (17% reduction)
- ✅ **Result:** All 8 matching-related tests passing, zero regressions

### Task 4: Analysis Helpers Tightening (✓ Complete)
- ✅ Extracted `_initialize_diagnostics` helper for default dict creation
- ✅ Extracted `_determine_data_status` helper to centralize status determination logic
- ✅ Refactored `summarize_price_file` with explicit 5-stage pipeline:
  1. Read and clean CSV
  2. Validate dates
  3. Calculate metrics
  4. Generate flags
  5. Build results and determine status
- ✅ Reduced `summarize_price_file` from 50 to 37 lines (26% reduction)
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate status determination logic
- ✅ **Result:** All 35 tests passing (including 3+ price file summary tests), zero regressions

## Outstanding Work

None - all high-priority technical debt tasks complete!

## Outstanding Work

### Technical Debt (Remaining Priority Order)

1. **Matching complexity** - Simplify `matching._match_instrument` branching logic (~60-90 min)
2. **Analysis helpers** - Tighten boundaries in `analysis.summarize_price_file` pipeline (~45-60 min)
3. **Documentation** - Review usage patterns across codebase for remaining tech debt items

### Data Curation

- Finalize tradable asset universe (broker fees, FX policy)
- Resolve unmatched instruments
- Document and remediate empty Stooq histories
- Establish volume data quality thresholds

### Next Development Phases

**Phase 2: Portfolio Construction** (Not Started)
- Strategy adapter interface
- Core allocation strategies (equal-weight, risk-parity, mean-variance)
- Rebalance logic (monthly/quarterly cadence, ±20% bands)
- Portfolio guardrails (max 25% per ETF, min 10% bonds, cap 90% equities)

**Phase 3: Backtesting Framework** (Not Started)
- Historical simulation engine
- Transaction cost modeling (commissions, slippage)
- Performance analytics (Sharpe, drawdown, turnover)
- Reporting outputs

**Phase 4: Advanced Features** (Future)
- Sentiment/news overlays as satellite tilts
- Black-Litterman view blending
- Regime-aware controls
- Automated Stooq refresh (requires online access approval)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Stooq coverage gaps | Limited asset universe | Document gaps, identify alternative sources |
| Transaction cost assumptions | Inaccurate backtest results | Validate against real broker fees |
| Currency inconsistencies | Wrong portfolio valuations | Establish clear FX policy before analytics |
| Complexity creep | Maintainability degradation | Disciplined scope management, regular refactoring |
| Offline operation | Stale data | Manual updates until online access approved |

## Notes

- See `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` for detailed refactoring history
- Update documentation after each milestone
- Keep Memory Bank synchronized with code changes
