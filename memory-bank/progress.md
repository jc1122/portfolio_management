- âœ… Refactored `matching.py` strategies to reduce cyclomatic complexity by 55%:
  - Extracted `_extension_is_acceptable` helper in TickerMatchingStrategy
  - Applied same pattern to StemMatchingStrategy
  - Broke BaseMarketMatchingStrategy into 3 focused helper methods:
    - `_build_desired_extensions` - deduplicate extensions while preserving order
    - `_get_candidate_extension` - single extraction point
    - `_find_matching_entry` - clear matching logic
- âœ… Extracted `_match_instrument` helpers to module level:

**Highlights (Stage 5)**

- Shared exception hierarchy routes consistent errors through CLIs and universe manager.
- End-to-end, performance, and production-data tests added (`tests/integration/`).
- Documentation refreshed (README, `docs/returns.md`, `docs/universes.md`) to describe new flows and testing strategy.
- CLI commands now exit non-zero for validation failures and log actionable guidance.

**Reference Docs:**

- `PHASE3_PORTFOLIO_SELECTION_PLAN.md` â€“ architectural blueprint
- `PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md` â€“ task-level tracking (current pointer: Task 5.x integration tasks)
- `PHASE3_QUICK_START.md` â€“ session checklist
- `docs/returns.md`, `docs/universes.md` â€“ detailed module guides

**Progress Tracking:**

- 34/45 tasks complete (Stages 1â€“4 delivered, Stage 5 partially delivered with testing/error-handling).
- Remaining: Stage 5 integration, performance, logging/UX polish, and final documentation updates.

**Next Focus:**

1. Task 5.1 â€“ Integration tests for the end-to-end pipeline.
1. Task 5.2 â€“ Performance optimisation / caching.
1. Task 5.3+ â€“ Error-handling polish, logging diagnostics, final documentation pass.

**Success Criteria (Phase 3):**

- All 45 tasks completed with â‰¥80% coverage on new modules (currently ~84%).
- Maintain â‰¥150 automated tests (currently 157) and keep new modules mypy-clean.
- CLI commands functional end-to-end (selection, classification, returns, universe management).
- Ability to process 1,000+ assets in \<30 s using cached Stooq data.
