# Progress Log

## Current Status
- Core documentation is in place and the Stooq data preparation pipeline (index + tradeable matching + export) is operational with cached metadata, multicore performance, richer diagnostics for price coverage/currency alignment, zero-volume severity tagging, and a default pandas-backed validator for price diagnostics (legacy CSV path retained only as a temporary fallback).
- Broker CSV ingestion and tradeable match/unmatched report generation now rely on pandas, eliminating bespoke row-by-row writers while preserving legacy fallbacks for no-pandas environments.
- The Stooq indexer now uses a thread-pooled `os.walk` traversal (default workers = CPU cores minus one) for maintainability; first benchmarks show identical outputs but roughly 1.8× slower scans versus the legacy queue/lock walker on a 500-file sample.

## Completed
- Initialized Memory Bank structure and populated it with the detailed investment methodology and implementation plan extracted from previous discussions.
- Documented risk constraints, rebalancing policies, and future sentiment-integration objectives.
- Built `scripts/prepare_tradeable_data.py` to scan unpacked Stooq archives, normalize broker tradeable lists, match symbols, and export curated price series; optimized the script with parallel directory traversal and caching (~40s first run, ~2s incremental).
- Expanded broker-to-Stooq ticker heuristics to cover TSX, Xetra, Euronext, Swiss, and Brussels suffixes; regenerated metadata and 4,342 price CSVs from a clean slate (full run ≈173 s).
- Hardened matching to reject cross-venue fallbacks, added alias rules for stubborn U.S. tickers, and augmented reports with per-instrument price range, row counts, and currency status.
- Latest run matched 5 ,560 instruments, exported 4 ,146 price files (skipping two empty histories), and clearly tagged 1 ,262 unmatched assets by missing extension (`.TO`, `.DE`, `.FR/.PA`, `.CH`) or alias requirements.
- Captured 258 LSE multi-currency ETFs as explicit currency overrides and surfaced two empty price files (`HSON.US`, `WPS.UK`) for remediation.
- Enhanced `scripts/prepare_tradeable_data.py` with configurable LSE currency handling, deeper file-level validation (duplicate dates, non-positive closes, missing/zero volume), a `data_flags` column in the match report, and automatic skipping/pruning of empty Stooq exports.
- Classified zero-volume issues into low/moderate/high/critical severities, regenerated the tradeable match report, and wrote `data/metadata/tradeable_data_flags.csv` to spotlight the 29 critical and 170 high-risk LSE listings alongside lower-severity U.S. blips—currently treated as warnings only, not filters.
- Benchmarked and promoted a pandas-based price-file summarizer (C-engine, selective column loads) to replace the manual CSV parser by default, logging warnings when the legacy path is used and measuring ~5 % average speedup over the fallback on 500-file batches.

## Outstanding Work
- Assemble the tradable asset list and broker fee schedule to inform backtest assumptions.
- Review `override` currency cases and decide whether FX conversion is required before backtesting; triage the empty Stooq histories now skipped during export.
- Reconcile remaining unmatched broker instruments (especially those needing `.TO`, `.DE`, `.FR/.PA`, `.CH`) or document proxy decisions; enrich metadata with currency/asset-class tags and monitor the high/critical zero-volume cohorts while remaining offline.
- Implement modular Python components (data fetch/clean, strategy adapters, backtesting, reporting) leveraging identified libraries.
- Define analytics/reporting templates (CLI summaries, CSV exports, charts) and establish logging conventions.
- Research and catalog open-source sentiment/news pipelines for future integration.
- Verify pandas availability in deployment environments and retire the legacy CSV summarizer once the dependency is ubiquitous.

## Risks & Issues
- Stooq coverage and history length may limit certain assets; alternative data sources might be needed.
- Transaction cost assumptions and slippage modeling must be validated against real broker fees.
- Potential complexity creep when integrating sentiment overlays; requires disciplined scope management.
- Currency inconsistencies across venues (e.g., LSE USD share classes) require clear policy before portfolio analytics can be trusted.
- Offline-only operation currently blocks automated dataset refresh; coordinate manual data transfer or wait for approval before attempting downloads.

## Notes
- Update documentation after each development milestone, especially when integrating new libraries or changing risk controls.
