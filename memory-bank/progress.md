# Progress Log

## Current Status
- Memory Bank now reflects the full project brief, product goals, system architecture, and technical stack for the offline portfolio builder.

## Completed
- Initialized Memory Bank structure and populated it with the detailed investment methodology and implementation plan extracted from previous discussions.
- Documented risk constraints, rebalancing policies, and future sentiment-integration objectives.

## Outstanding Work
- Assemble the tradable asset list and broker fee schedule to inform backtest assumptions.
- Implement modular Python components (data fetch/clean, strategy adapters, backtesting, reporting) leveraging identified libraries.
- Define analytics/reporting templates (CLI summaries, CSV exports, charts) and establish logging conventions.
- Research and catalog open-source sentiment/news pipelines for future integration.

## Risks & Issues
- Stooq coverage and history length may limit certain assets; alternative data sources might be needed.
- Transaction cost assumptions and slippage modeling must be validated against real broker fees.
- Potential complexity creep when integrating sentiment overlays; requires disciplined scope management.

## Notes
- Update documentation after each development milestone, especially when integrating new libraries or changing risk controls.
