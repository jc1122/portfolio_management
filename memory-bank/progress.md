# Progress Log

## Current Status
- Core documentation is in place and the Stooq data preparation pipeline (index + tradeable matching + export) is operational with cached metadata and multicore performance.

## Completed
- Initialized Memory Bank structure and populated it with the detailed investment methodology and implementation plan extracted from previous discussions.
- Documented risk constraints, rebalancing policies, and future sentiment-integration objectives.
- Built `scripts/prepare_tradeable_data.py` to scan unpacked Stooq archives, normalize broker tradeable lists, match symbols, and export curated price series; optimized the script with parallel directory traversal and caching (~40s first run, ~2s incremental).
- Expanded broker-to-Stooq ticker heuristics to cover TSX, Xetra, Euronext, Swiss, and Brussels suffixes; regenerated metadata and 4,342 price CSVs from a clean slate (full run ≈173 s).

## Outstanding Work
- Assemble the tradable asset list and broker fee schedule to inform backtest assumptions.
- Reconcile and map remaining unmatched broker instruments to Stooq tickers or flag gaps; enrich metadata with currency/asset-class tags.
- Implement modular Python components (data fetch/clean, strategy adapters, backtesting, reporting) leveraging identified libraries.
- Define analytics/reporting templates (CLI summaries, CSV exports, charts) and establish logging conventions.
- Research and catalog open-source sentiment/news pipelines for future integration.
- Download and unpack absent Stooq regional bundles (e.g., German/Xetra listings) to reduce the current ~1k unmatched instruments before the next matching pass.

## Risks & Issues
- Stooq coverage and history length may limit certain assets; alternative data sources might be needed.
- Transaction cost assumptions and slippage modeling must be validated against real broker fees.
- Potential complexity creep when integrating sentiment overlays; requires disciplined scope management.

## Notes
- Update documentation after each development milestone, especially when integrating new libraries or changing risk controls.
