### 2025-10-22 Update â€“ AssetSelector Vectorization Complete

- **Vectorized AssetSelector filtering pipeline** for 45-206x performance improvement on large universes:
  - Replaced `.apply()` with vectorized pandas string operations in `_filter_by_data_quality` (severity parsing using regex)
  - Replaced `.apply()` with vectorized datetime arithmetic in `_filter_by_history` (date range calculations)
  - Replaced `.apply()` with `Series.isin()` boolean operations in `_apply_lists` (allow/blocklist filtering)
  - Replaced `.iterrows()` with `to_dict("records")` in `_df_to_selected_assets` (dataclass instantiation)
- **Comprehensive benchmark suite** added to `tests/benchmarks/test_selection_performance.py`:
  - Generates synthetic 10k-row match reports with realistic filtering scenarios
  - Measures performance across 5 benchmark scenarios (1k basic, 10k basic/complex/severity/allowlist)
  - Documents baseline vs. optimized performance with statistical timing (mean, std, min, max)
- **Performance gains** (10k rows):
  - Basic filtering: 3871ms â†’ 52.77ms (**73x speedup**)
  - Complex filtering: 1389ms â†’ 17.70ms (**78x speedup**)
  - Severity filtering: 2171ms â†’ 41.88ms (**52x speedup**)
  - Allow/blocklist filtering: 4989ms â†’ 24.17ms (**206x speedup**)
- **All 76 existing tests pass** unchanged, confirming identical filtering semantics
- **Type checking passes** with zero mypy errors
- **Documentation** added to `docs/performance/assetselector_vectorization.md` with technical details and usage examples

### 2025-10-21 Update â€“ Large-Universe Backtest Hardening

- Documented the risk parity inverse-volatility fallback and mean-variance analytic tangency guard rails that keep 1,000-asset universes stable.
- Refreshed backtesting docs to highlight the normalised visualization exports (`viz_equity_curve.csv`, `viz_drawdown.csv`, `viz_rolling_metrics.csv`) so chart generation no longer produces blank plots.
- Logged the `long_history_1000` universe refresh (long-gap tickers removed, 2005-02-25 start) and captured where the derived prices/returns live under `outputs/long_history_1000/` (returns published as `long_history_1000_returns_daily.csv.gz`).
- Reorganised repository documentation: architecture specifications now live under `docs/architecture/`, tooling notes under `docs/tooling/`, the test-suite overview under `docs/testing/overview.md`, and historical cleanup/metrics reports were archived (`archive/cleanup/`, `archive/meta/`, `archive/reports/`). Root directory trimmed to just `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` for active guidance.

### 2025-10-19 Update â€“ Synthetic Workflow Integration Tests

- Implemented deterministic synthetic market generator (`tests/synthetic_data.py`) producing 50-year Stooq-style data for 40 assets with embedded validation scenarios (missing files, sparse histories, zero volume, negative prices, gaps, late starts).
- Added comprehensive integration suite (`tests/integration/test_synthetic_workflow.py`) covering:
  - Data preparation pipeline (indexing, matching, diagnostics, export) on synthetic fixtures.
  - UniverseManager strict vs. balanced universes, return calculation resilience, and coverage checks.
  - Portfolio construction across supported strategies (equal weight always; risk parity/mean-variance executed when dependencies available) with graceful handling of optimisation failures.
  - Backtesting engine smoke tests using synthetic prices/returns.
  - CLI smoke tests for `scripts.calculate_returns` and `scripts.construct_portfolio`.
- Added focused strategy regression tests to enforce both success (well-conditioned multivariate-normal returns) and failure (`InsufficientDataError` with short histories) paths for optional optimisers (`PyPortfolioOpt`, `riskparityportfolio`).
- Documented workflow plan/status in `docs/synthetic_workflow_plan.md` and added fixture usage guidance (`tests/fixtures/synthetic_workflow/README.md`).
- New tests increase suite count by 6 integration cases; runtime â‰ˆ 130s due to full workflow execution.

**Highlights (Stage 5)**

- Shared exception hierarchy routes consistent errors through CLIs and universe manager.
- End-to-end, performance, and production-data tests added (`tests/integration/`).
- Documentation refreshed (README, `docs/returns.md`, `docs/universes.md`) to describe new flows and testing strategy.
- CLI commands now exit non-zero for validation failures and log actionable guidance.

**Reference Docs:**

- `PHASE3_PORTFOLIO_SELECTION_PLAN.md` â€“ architectural blueprint
- `PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md` â€“ task-level tracking (current pointer: Task 5.x integration tasks)
- `PHASE3_QUICK_START.md` â€“ session checklist
- `docs/returns.md`, `docs/universes.md` â€“ detailed module guides

**Progress Tracking:**

- 34/45 tasks complete (Stages 1â€“4 delivered, Stage 5 partially delivered with testing/error-handling).
- Remaining: Stage 5 integration, performance, logging/UX polish, and final documentation updates.

**Next Focus:**

1. Task 5.1 â€“ Integration tests for the end-to-end pipeline.
1. Task 5.2 â€“ Performance optimisation / caching.
1. Task 5.3+ â€“ Error-handling polish, logging diagnostics, final documentation pass.

**Success Criteria (Phase 3):**

- All 45 tasks completed with â‰¥80% coverage on new modules (currently ~84%).
- Maintain â‰¥150 automated tests (currently 157) and keep new modules mypy-clean.
- CLI commands functional end-to-end (selection, classification, returns, universe management).
- Ability to process 1,000+ assets in \<30 s using cached Stooq data.

## Outstanding Work
