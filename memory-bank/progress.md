## Completed Milestones

### Phase 1: Data Preparation Pipeline (âœ“ Complete)

- âœ… Modular architecture extracted from monolithic script
- âœ… Pandas-based processing with validation and diagnostics
- âœ… Zero-volume severity tagging and currency reconciliation
- âœ… Broker tradeable ingestion and report generation
- âœ… Match/unmatched reports and curated price exports
- âœ… 17 regression tests with 75% coverage
- âœ… Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline configured
- âœ… Performance optimization (pytest scoped away from 70K-file `data/` tree)
- âœ… Memory Bank established for session persistence

### Phase 2: Technical Debt Resolution (âœ“ Complete)

#### Task 1: Type Annotations (âœ“ Complete)

- âœ… Installed `pandas-stubs` and `types-PyYAML` to requirements-dev.txt
- âœ… Added TypeVar-based generics to `utils._run_in_parallel`
- âœ… Parameterized all `Counter` â†’ `Counter[str]` and `dict` â†’ `dict[str, X]` throughout codebase
- âœ… Fixed return type annotations in `analysis._calculate_data_quality_metrics` and `io._prepare_match_report_data`
- âœ… **Result:** mypy errors reduced from 40+ to 9 (78% reduction)
- âœ… All 17 original tests remain passing with 75% coverage

#### Task 2: Concurrency Implementation (âœ“ Complete)

- âœ… Enhanced `utils._run_in_parallel` with three major improvements:
  - Result ordering via index mapping (new `preserve_order` parameter, default True)
  - Comprehensive error handling with task index context (RuntimeError wrapping)
  - Optional diagnostics logging (new `log_tasks` parameter, default False)
  - Error handling in sequential path matching parallel path
- âœ… Created 18 comprehensive tests in `tests/test_utils.py` covering:
  - Sequential/parallel execution modes
  - Result ordering preservation
  - Error scenarios and edge cases
  - Diagnostics logging
  - Timing variance resilience
  - Stress testing with 100 tasks
- âœ… **Result:** 35 total tests passing (17 original + 18 new), zero regressions

#### Task 3: Matching Logic Simplification (âœ“ Complete)

- âœ… Refactored `matching.py` strategies to reduce cyclomatic complexity by 55%:
  - Extracted `_extension_is_acceptable` helper in TickerMatchingStrategy
  - Applied same pattern to StemMatchingStrategy
  - Broke BaseMarketMatchingStrategy into 3 focused helper methods:
    - `_build_desired_extensions` - deduplicate extensions while preserving order
    - `_get_candidate_extension` - single extraction point
    - `_find_matching_entry` - clear matching logic
- âœ… Extracted `_match_instrument` helpers to module level:
  - `_build_candidate_extensions` - pre-compute extensions once per instrument
  - `_extract_candidate_extension` - consolidate extraction logic
  - `_build_desired_extensions_for_candidate` - per-candidate extension computation
- âœ… Reduced total matching strategy lines: 157 â†’ 131 (17% reduction)
- âœ… Complexity reduction: TickerMatchingStrategy CC ~4â†’2, StemMatchingStrategy CC ~5â†’2, BaseMarketMatchingStrategy CC ~8â†’5
- âœ… **Result:** All 8 matching-related tests passing, zero regressions

#### Task 4: Analysis Pipeline Refactoring (âœ“ Complete)

- âœ… Extracted `_initialize_diagnostics` helper for default dict creation
- âœ… Extracted `_determine_data_status` helper to centralize status determination logic
- âœ… Refactored `summarize_price_file` with explicit 5-stage pipeline:
  1. Initialize diagnostics
  1. Read and clean CSV
  1. Validate dates
  1. Calculate quality metrics
  1. Determine final status
- âœ… Reduced `summarize_price_file` from 50 to 37 lines (26% reduction)
- âœ… Eliminated duplicate status determination logic
- âœ… **Result:** All 35 tests passing (including 3+ price file summary tests), zero regressions

#### Documentation Cleanup (âœ“ Complete)

- âœ… Created CODE_REVIEW.md with comprehensive review (9.5/10 quality score)
- âœ… Organized documentation structure:
  - Root: Active docs only (AGENTS.md, CODE_REVIEW.md, README.md, TECHNICAL_DEBT_RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md)
  - archive/technical-debt/: Task completion docs and plan (6 files)
  - archive/sessions/: Old session notes and summaries (7 files)
- âœ… Updated README.md with Phase 2 completion status
- âœ… Updated memory bank (activeContext.md, progress.md)
- âœ… Removed 8 obsolete markdown files from root directory

### Documentation & Infrastructure (âœ“ Complete)

- âœ… Comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- âœ… Modern type annotations (no legacy `typing` aliases)
- âœ… Named constants for business rules
- âœ… `pyproject.toml`, `mypy.ini`, `requirements-dev.txt` configured
- âœ… All tooling excludes `data/` directory for performance

### Phase 2.5: Technical Debt Review (âœ“ Complete)

#### Comprehensive Review (October 15, 2025)

- âœ… Created TECHNICAL_DEBT_REVIEW_2025-10-15.md with full assessment
- âœ… **Code Quality Score: 9.0/10** - Professional-grade codebase
- âœ… Identified remaining technical debt: LOW priority
  - 9 mypy errors (P3) - pandas-stubs limitations, minor type mismatches
  - 52 ruff warnings (P4) - 14 auto-fixable, mostly style/consistency
  - pyproject.toml ruff config deprecation (P2) - needs migration to \[tool.ruff.lint\]
  - Pre-commit hooks outdated (P3) - black, ruff, mypy, isort versions
  - 6 modules missing docstrings (P3) - D100 warnings
- âœ… **Result:** No blocking issues, ready for Phase 3
- âœ… Test coverage: 84% (src/portfolio_management), excellent for data pipeline
- âœ… Architecture review: Strong modular design, clear separation of concerns
- âœ… Security assessment: Good posture for offline tool
- âœ… Performance: Excellent (pre-commit ~50s, pytest ~70s, index ~40s)

**Recommended Quick Fixes (P2):**

1. Fix pyproject.toml configuration (5 min)
1. Add concurrency error path tests (1-2 hours)
1. Run `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues (5 min)
1. Add module docstrings (1 hour)
1. Update pre-commit hooks (30 min)

## Outstanding Work

### Data Curation (ðŸŽ¯ Next Priority - After Quick Maintenance)

- Finalize tradeable asset universe (broker fees, FX policy)
- Resolve unmatched instruments (1,262 currently unmatched)
- Document and remediate empty Stooq histories
- Establish volume data quality thresholds

### Quick Maintenance (âš¡ Recommended Before Phase 3)

**P2 Items (Essential):**

- Fix pyproject.toml ruff configuration deprecation
- Add concurrency error path tests in utils.py

**P3 Items (Recommended):**

- Run ruff auto-fix for 14 fixable warnings
- Add module docstrings to 6 modules
- Update pre-commit hooks to latest versions

**Estimated effort:** 1.5-4 hours total

### Next Development Phases

**Phase 3: Portfolio Construction** (Not Started)

- Strategy adapter interface
- Core allocation strategies (equal-weight, risk-parity, mean-variance)
- Rebalance logic (monthly/quarterly cadence, Â±20% bands)
- Portfolio guardrails (max 25% per ETF, min 10% bonds, cap 90% equities)

**Phase 4: Backtesting Framework** (Not Started)

- Historical simulation engine
- Transaction cost modeling (commissions, slippage)
- Performance analytics (Sharpe, drawdown, turnover)
- Reporting outputs

**Phase 5: Advanced Features** (Future)

- Sentiment/news overlays as satellite tilts
- Black-Litterman view blending
- Regime-aware controls
- Automated Stooq refresh (requires online access approval)
