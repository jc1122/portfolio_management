## Historical Reference: Phase 2 Quick Maintenance

1. Kick off Phase 4 portfolio construction: implement equal-weight baseline, risk parity, and PyPortfolioOpt mean-variance adapters.
1. Maintain cleanup standards by keeping lint/mypy at zero, documenting changes as delivered, and preserving the 9.5+/10 quality bar.
1. Expand integration coverage to exercise upcoming strategy adapters end-to-end with existing fixtures and production configs.

## Coming Up

Phase 4 introduces portfolio construction strategies (equal-weight baseline, risk parity, mean-variance) on top of the prepared universes, followed by Phase 5 backtesting and Phase 6 advanced overlays.

**Current Metrics:**

- Test suite: 217 tests, 100% passing, ~85% coverage
- Type safety: 0 mypy errors
- Code quality: 9.5/10
- Technical debt: Minimal (~30 P4 style warnings)
- Total codebase: ~10,000 lines

## Key Decisions & Constraints

**Portfolio Construction (Implemented):**

- Three strategies: Equal-weight (baseline), Risk Parity, Mean-Variance (PyPortfolioOpt)
- Constraint enforcement: Max 25% per asset, min 10% bonds/cash, max 90% equity
- Strategy comparison utilities built-in
- Full exception hierarchy for error handling

**Backtesting Requirements (Phase 5):**

- Rebalance cadence: Monthly/quarterly with ±20% opportunistic bands
- Transaction costs: Model commissions and slippage explicitly
- Performance metrics: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, Expected Shortfall, volatility
- Visualization: Equity curves, drawdowns, allocations, attribution
- Decision logging: Record all rebalancing decisions with context

**Technical Approach:**

- Build on existing infrastructure (data prep, selection, classification, returns, universes, portfolio)
- Leverage established libraries where appropriate (empyrical for metrics)
- Maintain offline-first operation (no automated data downloads)
- Support CLI-driven workflow with configurable parameters
- Generate reports suitable for compliance and decision documentation

**Operational Constraints:**

- Offline operation mandated (no automated Stooq downloads)
- All filesystem-scanning tools must exclude `data/` directory
- Zero-volume anomalies flagged but not auto-remediated
- Asset universe limited to BOŚ and MDM platform availability

## Development Principles

1. **Maintain test coverage** - Keep 85%+ coverage, add tests for new features before implementation
1. **Document as you go** - Update Memory Bank after each session or significant milestone
1. **Modular design** - Keep clear boundaries between concerns, follow existing patterns
1. **Performance awareness** - Profile before optimizing, exclude `data/` from scans
1. **Incremental delivery** - Small, tested changes over large rewrites
1. **Type safety** - Maintain zero mypy errors, add type annotations to all new code
1. **Code quality** - Keep quality score at 9.5+/10, address ruff warnings in new code
1. **Backward compatibility** - Ensure new modules integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure
