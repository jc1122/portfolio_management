## �🚀 October 22, 2025 – OPTIMIZATION SPRINT SUMMARY

**Active Development Period:** October 19-22, 2025
**Branch:** `refactoring` (merged to main)
**Focus:** Performance improvements, memory management, and scalability
**Result:** 6 major initiatives completed with comprehensive testing and documentation

### Key Achievements Summary

| Initiative | Completion | Performance Gain | Status |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **AssetSelector Vectorization** | Oct 22 | 45-206x speedup | ✅ Complete |
| **PriceLoader Bounded Cache** | Oct 22 | 70-90% memory savings | ✅ Complete |
| **Statistics Caching** | Oct 22 | Avoids redundant calculations | ✅ Complete |
| **Streaming Diagnostics** | Oct 22 | Real-time validation | ✅ Complete |
| **BacktestEngine Optimization** | Oct 22 | O(n²) → O(rebalances) | ✅ Complete |
| **Incremental Resume** | Oct 22 | 3-5min → seconds | ✅ Complete |

### 1. AssetSelector Vectorization (45-206x Speedup)

**Objective:** Eliminate row-wise pandas operations (`.apply()`, `.iterrows()`) that were causing quadratic complexity

**What Was Done:**

- Replaced severity filtering `.apply()` with vectorized `Series.str.extract()` (regex-based)
- Replaced history calculation `.apply()` with vectorized datetime arithmetic (`pd.to_datetime()` + `Series.dt.days`)
- Replaced allow/blocklist `.apply()` with `Series.isin()` boolean mask operations
- Replaced dataclass conversion `.iterrows()` with `to_dict("records")` batch conversion

**Performance Results (10k row dataset):**

- Basic filtering: 3871ms → 52.77ms (**73x speedup**)
- Complex filtering: 1389ms → 17.70ms (**78x speedup**)
- Severity filtering: 2171ms → 41.88ms (**52x speedup**)
- Allow/blocklist filtering: 4989ms → 24.17ms (**206x speedup**)

**Testing:**

- All 76 existing tests passing – filtering semantics unchanged
- Added comprehensive benchmark suite in `tests/benchmarks/test_selection_performance.py`
- Benchmark scenarios cover 1k-10k row datasets with realistic filtering combinations
- Zero regressions; backward compatibility maintained

**Documentation:** `docs/performance/assetselector_vectorization.md`

**Code Quality:**

- Type safety: ✅ Zero mypy errors
- Test coverage: ✅ All existing tests pass
- Performance: ✅ Measured and documented
- Backward compatibility: ✅ 100% maintained

______________________________________________________________________

### 2. PriceLoader Bounded Cache (70-90% Memory Savings)

**Objective:** Prevent unbounded memory growth in PriceLoader during long CLI runs or wide-universe workflows

**What Was Done:**

- Replaced unbounded `dict[Path, pd.Series]` with `OrderedDict[Path, pd.Series]`
- Implemented LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction strategy
- Added configurable `cache_size` parameter (default: 1000 entries, set to 0 to disable)
- Added `clear_cache()` method for explicit cache clearing
- Added `cache_info()` method for monitoring cache statistics
- Updated `calculate_returns.py` CLI with `--cache-size` argument
- Thread-safe implementation: all operations protected by existing `_cache_lock`

**Memory Impact:**

- Before: Unbounded cache (could grow to thousands of entries during wide-universe runs)
- After: Bounded to 1000 entries (LRU eviction when full)
- Typical savings: **70-90% memory reduction** for wide-universe workflows (5000+ unique files)
- Maintains performance: Recently used files stay cached for fast access

**Testing (7 new comprehensive tests):**

- `test_cache_bounds_eviction` – LRU eviction when cache full
- `test_cache_lru_ordering` – Accessing cached entries updates LRU order
- `test_cache_disabled_when_size_zero` – cache_size=0 disables caching
- `test_clear_cache` – Explicit cache clearing works
- `test_cache_thread_safety` – Thread-safe concurrent operations
- `test_cache_empty_series_not_cached` – Empty series not cached
- `test_stress_many_unique_files` – 500 unique files with bounded memory

**Results:**

- All 23 analytics/script tests passing (11 PriceLoader + 10 ReturnCalculator + 2 CLI)
- Zero mypy type errors
- Zero security issues (CodeQL clean)
- Auto-fixed 14 ruff issues; no regressions

**Documentation:** `docs/returns.md` (Memory Management section)

**Backward Compatibility:**

- ✅ Fully backward compatible (default cache_size=1000)
- ✅ Existing code works without changes
- ✅ CLI users can customize via `--cache-size` argument
- ✅ No breaking API changes

______________________________________________________________________

### 3. Statistics Caching (Avoid Redundant Calculations)

**Objective:** Prevent redundant covariance and expected returns calculations during rebalancing with overlapping data windows

**What Was Done:**

- Implemented `RollingStatistics` class in `src/portfolio_management/portfolio/statistics/` (240+ lines)
- Caches covariance matrices and expected returns across rolling windows
- Automatic cache invalidation when data changes
- Integrated with `RiskParityStrategy` and `MeanVarianceStrategy`
- Optional parameter to both strategies for cache injection

**Benefits:**

- Monthly rebalancing with overlapping windows: Avoid redundant calculations
- Large universes (300+): Significant CPU and memory savings
- Deterministic performance: Consistent results regardless of cache state

**Testing:**

- 17 comprehensive unit tests (100% passing)
- 9 integration tests with optional dependencies
- Strategy regression tests for success and failure paths
- Full covariance/returns validation

**Documentation:** `STATISTICS_CACHING_SUMMARY.md`

**Implementation Details:**

- Cache key: (start_date, end_date, asset list)
- Automatic invalidation when new data loaded
- Thread-safe operations
- Compatible with both PyPortfolioOpt and riskparityportfolio

______________________________________________________________________

### 4. Streaming Diagnostics (Real-Time Validation)

**Objective:** Implement streaming validation pipeline for Stooq data with chunk-based processing

**What Was Done:**

- Streaming pipeline for incremental data validation
- Chunk-based processing with state management
- Real-time detection of data quality issues (gaps, outliers, anomalies)
- Efficient memory usage (process one chunk at a time)
- Complete diagnostic reporting

**Benefits:**

- Memory efficient: Process gigabyte-scale datasets incrementally
- Real-time feedback: Issues detected as data processes
- State preservation: Context maintained across chunks
- Production ready: Comprehensive error handling

**Documentation:** `STREAMING_DIAGNOSTICS_COMPLETE.md`

**Implementation:**

- Chunk-based iteration through data files
- Quality checks at each chunk (volume, price anomalies, gaps)
- State aggregation across chunks
- Comprehensive diagnostics output

______________________________________________________________________

### 5. BacktestEngine Optimization (O(n²) → O(rebalances))

**Objective:** Eliminate quadratic work from rebuilding full-history DataFrame slices on every trading day

**What Was Done:**

- Consolidated rebalancing logic to create DataFrame slices **only when actually rebalancing**
- Removed unnecessary daily slice creation (previously done on every day)
- Reduced code complexity: 30 lines → 18 lines
- Maintained exact same functionality and results

**Performance Results (10-year daily backtest, 50 assets):**

- **Monthly rebalancing:** 95% reduction in operations (~2,404 fewer slices)
- **Quarterly rebalancing:** 98% reduction in operations (~2,481 fewer slices)
- **Weekly rebalancing:** 80% reduction in operations (~2,016 fewer slices)

**Complexity Reduction:**

- Before: O(n²) – created slices for every past day on every day
- After: O(rebalances) – creates slices only when rebalancing

**Code Quality:**

- Cleaner, more maintainable implementation
- Same test coverage maintained
- Zero behavioral changes (all tests pass)
- Better performance for large backtests

**Documentation:** `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`

______________________________________________________________________

### 6. Incremental Resume Feature (3-5min → Seconds)

**Objective:** Skip redundant processing in `prepare_tradeable_data.py` when inputs unchanged

**What Was Done:**

- Hash-based caching system for input file state tracking
- SHA256 hashes for each input file
- Comparison with cached metadata
- Automatic rebuild detection when inputs change
- Preserves all processing logic; only skips when appropriate

**Performance Results:**

- **Before:** 3-5 minutes for every run (even with unchanged inputs)
- **After:** Seconds when inputs unchanged (500+ files, 70k+ data files)
- **First run:** Normal processing time
- **Subsequent runs (unchanged):** ~2-3 seconds (hash comparison only)

**Benefits:**

- Dramatically speeds iterative development
- Makes interactive testing practical
- Automatic change detection (no manual cache clearing needed)
- Backward compatible (works with all existing data)

**Documentation:** `INCREMENTAL_RESUME_SUMMARY.md`

**Implementation:**

- Metadata cache file tracks input state
- SHA256 hashes for reliable change detection
- Graceful fallback to full processing when needed
- Thread-safe operations

## Historical Context (Oct 18 and Earlier)

## Historical Context (Oct 18 and Earlier)

### Oct 21: Long-History Universe Hardening

- Documented the large-universe safeguards for both risk parity and mean-variance strategies, referencing the newly refreshed `long_history_1000` dataset.
- Confirmed the `long_history_1000` roster now excludes long-gap tickers and delivers clean daily prices/returns (2005-02-25 onward) under `outputs/long_history_1000/` (returns stored as the compressed `long_history_1000_returns_daily.csv.gz`).
- Updated the backtest CLI guidance to note the normalised visualization exports that keep equity and drawdown charts populated.
- Sanitised repository documentation: moved architecture specs to `docs/architecture/`, tooling references to `docs/tooling/`, testing overview to `docs/testing/overview.md`, and archived historical cleanup/metrics memos under `archive/`. Root now only exposes `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` for active reference.

### Latest Update – 2025-10-19 (Synthetic Workflow Validation)

- Added deterministic synthetic Stooq dataset generator `tests/synthetic_data.py` covering 40 assets across equities, bonds, REITs, and alternatives with embedded data-quality edge cases (missing files, sparse histories, zero volume, negative prices, gaps).
- Introduced `tests/integration/test_synthetic_workflow.py` to exercise the full offline workflow:
  - Data preparation (indexing, matching, diagnostics, exports) on synthetic fixtures.
  - Universe loading (strict vs. balanced), return calculation resilience, and coverage assertions.
  - Portfolio construction across available strategies (equal weight mandatory; risk parity/mean-variance executed when dependencies present).
  - Backtesting engine runs and CLI smoke tests for `calculate_returns` and `construct_portfolio`.
- Added dedicated strategy regression tests ensuring optional dependencies execute both successful optimisations (well-conditioned multivariate normal returns) and expected rejections (`InsufficientDataError`) when history is too short.
- Documented plan and status in `docs/synthetic_workflow_plan.md`; fixtures guidance added under `tests/fixtures/synthetic_workflow/README.md`.

### Latest Update – 2025-10-18 (Night - GitHub Actions CI Fix)

**Fixed GitHub Actions Test Collection Issue:**

✅ Updated GitHub Actions workflow to properly skip integration tests

**Issue Analysis:**

- GitHub Actions reported 178 collected tests vs 231 locally
- Integration tests (`tests/integration/`) were marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`
- CI environment lacks production data files required by integration tests (e.g., `data/processed/tradeable_prices/`)
- Tests were being skipped (counted as `sssssss` in output) but still considered part of test collection
- This discrepancy was causing confusion about test completeness in CI

**Solution Implemented:**

- Updated `.github/workflows/tests.yml` to run: `pytest -m "not integration"`
- This explicitly tells pytest to skip integration tests, removing them from collection report
- Now CI will report only the applicable 178 tests (all non-integration tests)
- Integration tests will only run locally where data is available
- `--strict-markers` in pyproject.toml ensures all markers are properly defined

**Test Distribution After Fix:**

- Total local tests: 231 ✅
  - Non-integration (CI): 178 ✅
  - Integration (local only): 53 ✅

- Performance metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, ES, volatility)
- Visualization system for performance and attribution
- Decision logging framework
- CLI for backtest execution and analysis

**Estimated Timeline:** 30-40 hours over 5-7 days

## Phase 3 Progress

- ✅ Stage 1: Asset selection core models, filters, CLIs, fixtures, and unit coverage delivered.
- ✅ Stage 2: Classification taxonomy, rule engine, overrides, and CLI shipped.
- ✅ Stage 3: Return calculation rebuilt with validation, alignment, missing-data controls, and CLI enhancements; reference docs published.
- ✅ Stage 4: Universe management (YAML schema, CLI suite, curated sleeves) completed with documentation.
- ✅ Stage 5: Integration, performance validation, and cleanup complete – caching baselines set, CLI UX polished, and error handling unified.

**Test Suite:** 171 tests (unit + CLI + integration + performance smoke), ~86 % coverage with production-fixture validation.

## Historical Reference: Phase 2 Quick Maintenance

1. Kick off Phase 4 portfolio construction: implement equal-weight baseline, risk parity, and PyPortfolioOpt mean-variance adapters.
1. Maintain cleanup standards by keeping lint/mypy at zero, documenting changes as delivered, and preserving the 9.5+/10 quality bar.
1. Expand integration coverage to exercise upcoming strategy adapters end-to-end with existing fixtures and production configs.

## Coming Up

Phase 4 introduces portfolio construction strategies (equal-weight baseline, risk parity, mean-variance) on top of the prepared universes, followed by Phase 5 backtesting and Phase 6 advanced overlays.

**Current Metrics:**

- Test suite: 217 tests, 100% passing, ~85% coverage
- Type safety: 0 mypy errors
- Code quality: 9.5/10
- Technical debt: Minimal (~30 P4 style warnings)
- Total codebase: ~10,000 lines

## Key Decisions & Constraints

**Portfolio Construction (Implemented):**

- Three strategies: Equal-weight (baseline), Risk Parity, Mean-Variance (PyPortfolioOpt)
- Constraint enforcement: Max 25% per asset, min 10% bonds/cash, max 90% equity
- Strategy comparison utilities built-in
- Full exception hierarchy for error handling

**Backtesting Requirements (Phase 5):**

- Rebalance cadence: Monthly/quarterly with ±20% opportunistic bands
- Transaction costs: Model commissions and slippage explicitly
- Performance metrics: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, Expected Shortfall, volatility
- Visualization: Equity curves, drawdowns, allocations, attribution
- Decision logging: Record all rebalancing decisions with context

**Technical Approach:**

- Build on existing infrastructure (data prep, selection, classification, returns, universes, portfolio)
- Leverage established libraries where appropriate (empyrical for metrics)
- Maintain offline-first operation (no automated data downloads)
- Support CLI-driven workflow with configurable parameters
- Generate reports suitable for compliance and decision documentation

**Operational Constraints:**

- Offline operation mandated (no automated Stooq downloads)
- All filesystem-scanning tools must exclude `data/` directory
- Zero-volume anomalies flagged but not auto-remediated
- Asset universe limited to BOŚ and MDM platform availability

## Development Principles

1. **Maintain test coverage** - Keep 85%+ coverage, add tests for new features before implementation
1. **Document as you go** - Update Memory Bank after each session or significant milestone
1. **Modular design** - Keep clear boundaries between concerns, follow existing patterns
1. **Performance awareness** - Profile before optimizing, exclude `data/` from scans
1. **Incremental delivery** - Small, tested changes over large rewrites
1. **Type safety** - Maintain zero mypy errors, add type annotations to all new code
1. **Code quality** - Keep quality score at 9.5+/10, address ruff warnings in new code
1. **Backward compatibility** - Ensure new modules integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure
