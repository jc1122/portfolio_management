# Project Cleanup & Optimization Summary

## Performance Fix: Pre-commit Hook (October 2025)

**Issue:** Pre-commit pytest hook stalled because test discovery scanned the 70K-file `data/` tree.

**Solution:**
- Scoped pytest to `tests/` via `pyproject.toml`
- Reinstated local pytest hook with `pytest -n auto` and `pass_filenames: false` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

**Result:** Test collection <3s, full pre-commit â‰ˆ50s, all 17 tests passing.

**Ongoing Guidance:** All tooling (pytest, ruff, mypy, etc.) must exclude `data/` directory to maintain performance.

## Code Refactoring: Modularization (October 14-15, 2025)

**Goal:** Transform monolithic `prepare_tradeable_data.py` into maintainable module structure.

**Completed:**
- Extracted 6 focused modules: `models`, `io`, `analysis`, `matching`, `stooq`, `utils`
- Reduced main script to CLI orchestrator only
- Improved test coverage to 75%
- Added comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- Established Memory Bank for persistent context

**See:** `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` for complete details and next steps.
