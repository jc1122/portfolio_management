# Agent Operating Instructions

## Session Boot Checklist
1. Read this `AGENTS.md` file in full.
2. Read every core Memory Bank file in the `memory-bank/` directory:
   - `projectbrief.md`
   - `productContext.md`
   - `systemPatterns.md`
   - `techContext.md`
   - `activeContext.md`
   - `progress.md`
3. Review any additional documentation under `memory-bank/` if present.

## Documentation Principles
- The agent's memory resets between sessions; the Memory Bank is the only persistent context. Keep it accurate and complete.
- Update Memory Bank documents whenever new information, patterns, or decisions surface.
- When asked to **update memory bank**, review every file before recording changes, with special attention to `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
- Record unknowns and open questions explicitly so they can be resolved in later sessions.

## Working Guidelines
- Follow the project instructions maintained in the Memory Bank before taking action.
- Plan work when tasks are non-trivial, share the plan, and keep it updated as progress is made.
- Use concise comments and documentation to explain complex decisions.
