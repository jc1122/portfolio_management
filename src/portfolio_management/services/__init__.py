"""High-level service layer for orchestrating portfolio workflows.

This package exposes service classes that coordinate complex operations across
multiple modules while keeping the orchestration logic separate from command
line entry points. Services provide a programmatic API that mirrors the
behaviour of the CLI scripts, enabling easier testing and reuse.
