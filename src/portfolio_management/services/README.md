# Service Layer

The service layer provides orchestration helpers for high-level workflows. Each
service wraps an existing subsystem and exposes a focused API suitable for
scripts, notebooks, or external automation.

## Available Services

### `DataPreparationService`
Coordinates the tradeable instrument preparation pipeline. Handles Stooq index
management, matching, report generation, and incremental resume support.

### `PortfolioConstructionService`
Wraps `PortfolioConstructor` with optional preselection and comparison helpers to
construct portfolios from either in-memory data or CSV files.

### `BacktestService`
Simplifies running the historical backtesting engine with a small registry of
strategies and dependency injection hooks for testing.

### `UniverseManagementService`
Provides programmatic access to universe listing, inspection, loading, and
validation workflows that were previously only exposed via the CLI.

Each service is designed to be testableâ€”dependencies can be injected for unit
coverage while defaults mirror the production configuration used by CLI scripts.
